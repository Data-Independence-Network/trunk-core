# Story Books for Children

Doubling as requirements with module [input-output](https://github.com/beyond-decentralized/AIRroot/issues/4) specifications.

The idea is to write different books about coconut trees. Let's see if we can make any age appropriate book on coconut trees become the requirements for the DIN project!

Existing or new children's story books tied to the DIN project cannot be generated (by AI).  There are deep philosophical issues preventing usage of fully or partially (AI) generated content.  These issues are yet to be fully discovered or identified to be certain.  Ultimately it is up to us to determine our future.  Each of our personal and collective decisions changes the future plan, for better or worse.  The decision to use AI generated content hasn't yet proven on a deep philosophical level to not change the long term (and very long term) outcomes for the worst.  Ultimately "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=le1QF3uoQNg">It's up to you</a>"!

## Types of Story Books for Children

[Toddler books](./Age_1_to_3) the are highest level requirements - like a mission statement.

[Books for 3-5 year old children](./Age_3_to_5) are high-level requirements -  on reliability and security.

[Books for 5-9 year old children](./Age_5_to_9) are very critical requirements - are about the top level modules of the project.

[Books for 9-13 year old children](./Age_9_to_13) are critical requirements - they are the top level functional requirements.

[Books for 13-15 year old children](./Age_13_to_15) are very important requirements - they are the general functional requirements.
