# Story Books for Children

Doubling as requirements with module [input-output](https://github.com/beyond-decentralized/AIRroot/issues/4) specifications.

The idea is to write different books about coconut trees. Let's see if we can make any age appropriate book on coconut trees become the requirements for the DIN project!

## Types of Story Books for Children

[Toddler books](./Age_1_to_3) the are highest level requirements - like a mission statement.

[Books for 3-5 year old children](./Age_3_to_5) are high-level requirements -  on reliability and security.

[Books for 5-9 year old children](./Age_5_to_9) are very critical requirements - are about the top level modules of the project.

[Books for 9-13 year old children](./Age_9_to_13) are critical requirements - they are the top level functional requirements.

[Books for 13-15 year old children](./Age_13_to_15) are very important requirements - they are the general functional requirements.
