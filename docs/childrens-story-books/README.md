# Story Books for Children

Doubling as requirements with module [input-output](https://github.com/beyond-decentralized/AIRroot/issues/4) specifications.

The idea is to write different books about coconut trees. Let's see if we can make any age appropriate book on coconut trees become the requirements for the DIN project!

## Types of Story Books for Children

[Toddler books](./Age_1_to_3) the are highest level requirements - like a mission statement.

Books for children 3-5 years old are high-level requirements -  on reliability and security.

Books for 5-9 year olds are very critical requirements - are about the top level modules of the project.

Books for 9-13 year olds are critical requirements - they are the top level functional requirements.

Books for 13-15 year olds are very important requirements - they are the general functional requirements.
