# Story Books for 13 to 15 year old children

Doubling as requirements with module [input-output](https://github.com/beyond-decentralized/AIRroot/issues/4) specifications.

The idea is to write different books with a strong connection to coconut trees.  In this folder they should be for 13 to 15 year old children.  Let's see if we can make any age appropriate book on coconut trees become the requirements for the DIN project!

Story Books for the 13 to 15 year old children are very important requirements - they are the general functional requirements.

When adding a children's story book (or a series of children's story books) to this folder, can you place it in a directory (or nested directory), please?
