# Story Books for toddlers

Doubling as requirements with module [input-output](https://github.com/beyond-decentralized/AIRroot/issues/4) specifications.

The idea is to write different books with a strong connection to coconut trees.  In this folder they should be for toddlers.  Let's see if we can make any age appropriate book on coconut trees become the requirements for the DIN project!

Toddler books are the highest level requirements are are the easiest to tie to the DIN project.

When adding children's story books (or series of children's story books) to this folder, can you place in in a directory (or nested directories), please?
