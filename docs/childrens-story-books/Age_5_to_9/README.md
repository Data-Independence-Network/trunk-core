# Story Books for 5 to 9 year old children

Doubling as requirements with module [input-output](https://github.com/beyond-decentralized/AIRroot/issues/4) specifications.

The idea is to write different books with a strong connection to coconut trees.  In this folder they should be for 5 to 9 year old children.  Let's see if we can make any age appropriate book on coconut trees become the requirements for the DIN project!

Story Books for the 5 to 9 year old children are very critical requirements - are about the top level modules of the project.

When adding children's story books (or series of children's story books) to this folder, can you place in in a directory (or nested directories), please?
