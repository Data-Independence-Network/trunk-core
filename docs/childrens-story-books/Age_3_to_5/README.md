# Story Books for 3 to 5 year old children

Doubling as requirements with module [input-output](https://github.com/beyond-decentralized/AIRroot/issues/4) specifications.

The idea is to write different books with a strong connection to coconut trees.  In this folder they should be for 3 to 5 year old children.  Let's see if we can make any age appropriate book on coconut trees become the requirements for the DIN project!

Story Books for the 3 to 5 year old children are the high-level requirements - on reliability and security.

When adding a children's story book (or a series of children's story books) to this folder, can you place it in a directory (or nested directory), please?
