# Story Books for 3 to 5 year old children

Doubling as requirements with module [input-output](https://github.com/beyond-decentralized/AIRroot/issues/4) specifications.

The idea is to write different books with a strong connection to coconut trees.  In this folder they should be for 3 to 5 year old children.  Let's see if we can make any age appropriate book on coconut trees become the requirements for the DIN project!

Just like the <a href="../../../../issues/1">programming code</a>, code the existing or new children's story books tied to the DIN project or the related [BD](https://github.com/beyond-decentralized) and [PTWE](https://github.com/Past-The-War-Earth/) projects cannot be generated (by AI).  There are deep philosophical issues preventing usage of fully or partially (AI) generated content.  These issues are yet to be fully discovered or identified to be certain.  Ultimately it is up to us to determine our future.  Each of our personal and collective decisions changes the future plan, for better or worse.  The decision to use AI generated content hasn't yet proven on a deep philosophical level to not change the long term (and very long term) outcomes for the worst.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=le1QF3uoQNg">It's up to you</a>!

Story Books for the 3 to 5 year old children are the high-level requirements - on reliability and security.

When adding a children's story book (or a series of children's story books) to this folder, can you place it in a directory (or nested directory), please?
